# btcBalance
An Ionic web app, designed primarily for use on mobile to store wallet addresses and show btc and usd balances.

Also opens up a Google search showing GBP conversion.

**WARNING** - This uses the https://blockchain.info/balance api to get balances. If you take the whole privacy thing super, extremely seriously you should probably use your own node to get any info on your coin. This doesn't give any of your info away, but a determined actor could probably use IP addresses to link a wallet to a person. Probably not worth worrying about if you have 0.000213 btc
